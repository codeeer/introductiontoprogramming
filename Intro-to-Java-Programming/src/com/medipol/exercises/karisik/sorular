3- Show the Java code to​ declare​ a variable of type String and​ initialize​ it to “Whatever”.
String myString = “Whatever”; or
String myString = new String(“Whatever”);

4-Show the Java code to​ declare​ and​ allocate​ an array with 497 elements of type double.
double [] array = new double[497];
5-Show one line of Java code that declares, allocates,
 and initializes an array of type integer 
 with​ exactly 4 elements whose values 
 are 97, 33, 44, and 12, in that order.
 
 int[] array = {97,33,44,12}

​6-Write a Java​ conditional ​statement that implements
 the​ ​table below, where ​grade​ is an integer 
 and ​school​ is a string. Both variables have been declared and ​grade ​has been initialized to a value greater than or equal to 1:
  If ​grade​ is: 			Set ​school​ to:
  1, 2, 3, 4, 5			Elementary School
  6, 7, 8				Junior High
  9, 10, 11, 12			High School
   > 12					College

 15.2 <= limit && limit <= 62.9
 8-Show the declaration for a method called​ myMethod ​that 
 1) is visible outside the class, 
 2) can only​ ​access class (static) variables, 
 3) returns an array of integers, and 
 4) accepts two parameters which are a String and double, in that order.
